        Everyone gets stressed from time to time. Squeezing a stress ball going for a run, practicing meditation and getting a good night sleep might be the most conventional way of battling stress. Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period of time can lead to a feeling of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion, often called burnout. But if meditation is not your thing, Cambridge University expert reveals pretending your belly is balloon and hugging your pet could help you feel more relaxed. Dr Olivia Remes is a world-renowned expert in managing stress. Luckily, she has some breathing exercises she swears by.

            Vikki Mills, 28, from Lincoln, tipped the scales at 28 stone and struggled to squeeze into a size 32 when she decided to lose weight in January 2021. Vikki applied herself and soon found the weight dropping off after she became addicted to exercise rather than food. She ditched greasy takeaways for chicken and rice. She went on to lose a staggering 10 stone in just 20 months - now weighing 18 stone - and slips into a slender size 18 with ease. Vikki has since climbed mountains, joined women's strength competitions and even managed to pull a 40-tonne truck over 10 metres (left, before the weight loss; centre, after her weight loss; right, pulling the truck).

            Brycen Wright, 10, was diagnosed with Goldenhar syndrome at birth after doctors spotted his underdeveloped right ear and enlarged kidneys. But a few years ago the right side of his jaw also stopped growing, which he was last month sent for surgery to repair. Doctors have now fitted him with a device - called a jaw distractor - that his mother Briana, 30, must wind forward every morning to gradually force the jaw bone apart, encouraging it to grow. She said none of this hurts her son, but it must be done for the next 13 weeks and has led to him taking time off school. Forcing the bone to grow will help with speech and breathing as it allows the tongue to move further forward in the mouth. Many Goldenhar syndrome sufferers experience sleep apnoea, where the tongue stops breathing while they sleep because it is too far back in the jaw.

            NHS staff who lie to cover-up poor care in the health service should face a criminal charge, the author of the damming probe into the East Kent maternity scandal, where 45 babies died needlessly, has said. The damning report published yesterday found at least 45 babies died unnecessarily due to 11 years of 'deep-rooted' failures in care at East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust. In total 97 babies and mothers came to significant harm due to 'deplorable' care by maternity staff, some with lifelong injuries. Dr Bill Kirkup (inset) noted that this is just the latest maternity scandal to rock the health service and warned that greater change was needed to 'break the cycle'. He called for a 'public service accountability law' to be introduced so organisations can be prosecuted if they stage cover-ups in future tragedies. 'It would place a legal duty on public bodies to be truthful and not to conceal problems,' he said. The report itself found NHS trusts couldn't always be trusted to tell the truth when things go wrong and instead focus on 'reputation management'. 'The default response of almost every organisation subject to public scrutiny or criticism is to think first of managing its reputation, as is evident from a great many instances within the NHS,' it reads. Dr Kirkup also called for a national system to spot worrying trends in NHS hospitals' maternity data should be established so issues could be detected earlier, and further tragedy avoided. Bex Walton's (left) son Tommy (bottom left) is one of the babies who died at the Trust. Danielle Clark (right) suffered a traumatic birth at one of the Trust's hospitals with her son Noah (bottom right). Families have also said this must be the last maternity scandal to hit the NHS.

            Jade Buckingham (left), from Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, found out that she was pregnant with twins in September 2017. Despite being born six weeks early in spring 2018, non-identical twins Lanaé (left) and Lavell (right) were healthy - but they had completely different skin tones. While the 25-year-old's daughter Lanaé has darker skin and hair, her son Lavell has blonde hair and a lighter skin tone - a one in 500 phenomena.

            Photos of fetal cells in a petri dish provided by a coalition of abortion providers and activists show that an embryo in the early stages of gestation lack discernible human characteristics like fully formed organs. Anti-abortion advocates have inaccurately depicted embryos as far more developed than they truly are, according to OB-GYNs. Abortions performed at nine weeks are banned in 14 states.

            The drop in oestrogen and progesterone that causes the menopause has a vast array of effects on the body, some of which are totally bizarre. On average, women will experience at least 10 symptoms when it hits, with more than 40 common tell-tale signs well known about. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) helps ease most of these symptoms, but shortages in the drugs earlier this year left many desperate women having to overcome each of them individually. Also, women with a history of breast, womb or ovarian cancer, high blood pressure, blood clots or liver disease are not recommended the medication, leaving them with no option but to treat each symptom as they appear.

            Donald Trump (left), Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher (right) apparently got by on just four or five hours' slumber, but a study of 8,000 Britons suggests this is ill-advised. Researchers looked at 7,864 British people, who were asked at the age of 50, 60 and 70 how much sleep they got on an average week night.

            Henry Dimbleby (inset), who founded Leon, said there is 'definitely a case' for the Government re-introducing British Restaurants across the country to offer cheap and healthy meals. He said Government should make use of 'extraordinary' school kitchens to dish out meals to the public. The community kitchen initiative (pictured left and right) was first spearheaded by wartime Food Minister Lord Woolton to boost the nation's health and strength during WW2.

            Living proof of the enormous potential of genomics is Aurea Yenmai Smigrodzki, a happy and healthy two-year-old girl from Clemmons, North Carolina. Aurea was the world's first PGT-P baby, meaning she has been scientifically selected for her genes, and is statistically less likely to develop a genetic disease or disorder in her lifetime. She is pictured left with her father Rafal Smigrodzk. PGT-P - preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic disorders - is conducted in conjunction with IVF and allows prospective parents to actively select which of their own embryos to take, based on the strength of its genes. The difference between PGT-P and other screening tools is that PGT-P can screen for more genetically complex diseases, ie, those that are influenced by genetic variants in more than one gene. This may include heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity - all of which do not have a single genetic cause, but develop due to multiple genetic factors in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, such as exercise, diet or pollution. Becoming a parent for the first time is a major moment for anyone - but for Laura Gayton, right, giving birth to a healthy, crying baby boy felt nothing short of a 'miracle'. Laura, a swimming teacher from Kettering, Northants, is one of around 10,800 people in the UK with cystic fibrosis (CF), a progressive genetic disease that claims the lives of half of those affected before the age of 40. When she was diagnosed at just two months old, Laura's parents were told their daughter would be lucky to make it to her 30th birthday. But today, Laura, 31, has never felt fitter, thanks to a pioneering new treatment - and after four years of trying, she and her husband Nicholas, 33, a fire station commander, now have a 13-month-old son, Louis.

            As the cost of food escalates it may seem more difficult to eat healthily, but in the freezer section of the supermarket is a range of staples that can be used to create wholesome, inexpensive meals - as these recipes here, developed especially for Mail readers, show. Frozen food is often considerably cheaper because it has a much longer shelf life, which means supermarkets can bulk buy without fear of unsold food being wasted. And it can be better for you: 'Frozen food can often be more nutritious than "fresh",' says dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker. 'Most fresh fruit and vegetables are picked before they are ripe, and stored, then treated, so they can ripen during transportation but, as a result, this gives them less time to develop a full range of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.

      DR MEGAN ROSSI: There is nothing better than that holiday feeling, as the stresses and strains of your life just seem to ebb away. And for some people, a holiday is just what their gut needs, too. But I don't mean literally going away - just giving it a brief respite from its usual routine. This kind of break can really help people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), as well as anyone who's had a stomach bug - when your gut may be more sensitive than usual.

            Katherine Wood, from Perth, spent years believing her body 'was a failure' after previously trying to lose weight - but nothing seemed to work. She tried fasting, drinking smoothies, the 5:2 diet, cutting portion sizes, but couldn't keep the cravings away. It wasn't until she tried the Health with Bec program that she began to see progress. In just eight months she managed to lose 17kg.

            The variant - which is a hybrid of Omicron and the original Wuhan virus - killed 80 per cent of mice infected with it at Boston University (the lab, shown top and bottom right). When a similar group of rodents was exposed to the standard Omicron strain, however, they all survived and only experienced 'mild' symptoms. The scientists also infected human cells with the hybrid variant and found it was five times more infectious than Omicron. This suggests the man-made virus might be the most contagious form yet. It will no doubt surprise many Americans that such experiments continue to go on in the US despite concerns similar studies may have led to the global Covid outbreak.

            From today all bird keepers in Britain must follow strict measures by law to protect flocks from bird flu, including keeping free range birds in fenced areas and stringent biosecurity for staff on farms. The UK has faced its largest ever outbreak of the disease in the past year with more than 200 cases confirmed across the country since late October 2021 - 30 of which were confirmed since the beginning of this month.

            David Sergeant (pictured), from Seacroft in Leeds, said he hasn't been able to see a dentist for '10 or 15 years' - even after receiving an GP referral. As a result, he's been forced to use pliers or his hands to pluck out loose teeth. Before facing the ordeal, the 50-year-old says he has a 'couple of beers' and ibuprofen - but confesses that his DIY dentistry leaves him with a bloody mouth. He said: 'It doesn't feel very good. At the end of the day, I'm having to pull my own teeth out when I should have somebody looking after me.'

            Statistics released earlier this month show almost two million women are being prescribed HRT by the NHS in England alone but there is a financial implication. Last week, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Menopause, released their report calling for health checks for women over the age of 45 and free HRT. Mariella Frostrup (pictured left) is campaigning for more awareness and support for women. Pictured right: Penny Lancaster and Rod Stewart. Inset L-R: Gabby Logan, Davin McCall, and Lisa Snowdon

            Health Secretary Thérèse Coffey (left) has been branded 'moronic' by a Cambridge microbiology professor over her 'nuts' plans to let patients get antibiotics without seeing a GP which could increase the prevalence and dangers of drug-resistant bacteria like MRSA. Cambridge University's Professor Stephen Baker (right), an expert in molecular microbiology and antimicrobial resistance, said that overuse of antibiotics would lead to higher chances of drug-resistant disease.

            A person's personality can have drastic effects on their overall health, many studies have found. People who are extroverted and more outgoing are more likely to be obese but better in bed. Type A personalities who are more competitive are more stressed out, but will avoid diabetes. Conscientious people live longer but they have the traits most associated with compulsive disorders. Introverted people are more physically fit than extroverts - but more likely to have mental health issues.

            Wim Hof (pictured) has become known worldwide as 'The Iceman' after withstanding freezing temperatures, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in shorts, and standing in a container full of ice cubes for 112 minutes. The 63-year-old is on a mission to change the world and teach others about the 'tremendous benefits' that await when humans reconnect with nature. 'We're always in this state of weakening warmth, covered up in layers of clothing, and never exercise the cardiovascular system. So a cold shower a day keeps the doctor away,' Wim said. While he's become known as 'The Iceman' after withstanding freezing temperatures, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in shorts, and standing in a container full of ice cubes for 112 minutes - Wim says he 'hates' the cold.

            Dr Emeka Njoku (right), who runs Northfield Surgery in Thorne, near Doncaster, says he knows patients are frustrated, but 'it's something we need to work on, and we are trying.' The first challenge for Dr Njoku's patients is to get through on the clogged-up phone lines, which open at 8am. Like many practices, Northfield introduced online forms at the height of the pandemic, allowing patients to submit queries via its website. This was designed to take pressure off the phone lines. But no one wants to use them. These issues wouldn't be so disastrous if it wasn't for the main problem: soaring demand. 'Before the pandemic, patients had on average three appointments a year - now it's just under seven,' says Dr Njoku. 'Their needs are more complex because of problems stored up during the pandemic. All of this takes up time.' It is a similar situation up and down the country. Since the start of the pandemic, The Mail on Sunday has exposed (inset) the difficulties patients have faced accessing GP surgeries, and in May last year we launched a campaign to get doctors to see all patients in person again. This wasn't done lightly. It was prompted by readers who wrote to tell us of missed cancer symptoms and untreated infections that developed into life-threatening sepsis or pneumonia. The situation has undoubtedly improved since then.

            He is the Norwegian goal machine who is threatening to break every scoring record in England and has been compared to Mike Tyson in his peak. But there is more to Erling Haaland's footballing success than his Viking heritage and fearsome physique.  The £375,000-a-week Manchester City striker - who has hit the back of the net 20 times in just 12 games, and is tipped to add to his tally when the Citizens face rivals Liverpool on Sunday - has followed a host of quirky health practices to give him an edge over his rivals for years.

            Office for National Statistics (ONS) statisticians estimate more than 1.5million people were infected on any given day in the week up to October 3. Cases jumper more than 36 per cent on the 1.1million recorded the week before. They also surged in Wales and Northern Ireland, but the trend was 'uncertain' in Scotland, experts said. They were highest in most vulnerable older age groups, who will need 'close monitoring as we move through the colder months', they warned.

            NHS Blood and Transplant on Wednesday issued its first ever amber alert, triggering a wave of surgery postponements as hospitals move to ration blood supplies. Health chiefs fear the crisis could go on for months. If stocks continue to dip it could cause a red alert, which would see all but the most serious emergency surgeries cancelled. But researchers told MailOnline the situation could be eased with a drug that reduces surgery bleed by a third. Professor Ian Roberts, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said tranexamic acid could be a 'major part of the solution'. Now, medical bodies have told surgeons and anaesthetists to dish it out in all ops where more than 500ml of blood loss is likely.

       WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT: Eye doctor Katerina Kurteeva, from Newport Beach, California, can be seen scraping the stack of lenses out with a Q-tip. The patient, who is in her 70s, went to the eye doctor when her vision gradually turned blurry and a sharp pain in her eyes became unbearable. Even though seniors are encouraged to visit an eye doctor once a year for checkups, this woman had not been checked in two years. Dr Kurteeva said the woman had been wearing contact lenses for 30 years and believes it was a case of extreme oversight.

            Roughly 90 per cent of teenage girls experience pain around their period, and despite it being the leading cause of school absences for that age group, many do not seek help for it. Instead, they resort to over-the-counter pain relief which can have limited results. But what you eat on your period can play a big part in pain levels, The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) found. They recommend adding foods like salmon, tuna and vegetables to a girl's diet. Things like red meat, coffee, canned soup and sugary sweets like candies should instead be removed.

        Women posting risqué workout videos under the guise of motivating others to get fitter actually risk feeding a culture of sexual objectification, a male sports science researcher from Sweden suggests.

        It was predicted that a baby boom would occur after the Covid lockdowns. But a study now suggests that the opposite happened, with couples becoming more reluctant to start or expand a family.

            Sharon Walker (right), 53, from Nant-y-moel, Wales, noticed the lump on her foot (left) in January last year and decided to visit her GP after becoming concerned. The mother-of-two was diagnosed with lymphoedema - a chronic tissue-swelling condition - but she knew something wasn't right and asked a colleague to have a look at it. They told her to have a scan, which revealed she had a soft-tissue sarcoma - a rare form of cancer that usually affects the lungs - in June. In August that year, she had surgery to remove the 7cm (2.75in) lump and had a skin graft from her arm attached to the foot (inset).

            The NHS in England has hit a 'grim milestone' as its record breaking care backlog hits 7million, as analysis shows the health service is now performing less routine operations than before Covid. The 7million figure is is up from 6.8million in July and is the highest number since records began in August 2007. It means one in eight people in England are now waiting for routine NHS procedures, such as kip and knee replacements. Thinktanks said the figures were a 'grim milestone' and should act as warning to Government of the strain the NHS was under even before winter pressures begin to bite. This figure includes almost 390,000 patients who've been forced to wait over a year for treatment, often while in serious pain. This is up from 377,689 at the end of July and is the equivalent of one in 18 people on the entire waiting list. And shockingly, separate analysis by the BBC released suggests the NHS is carrying out fewer operations and treatments than before Covid. In the past year, an average of nearly 257,500 inpatient treatments, including hip and knee replacements, have been performed each month - 12 per cent lower than the year before the pandemic, it said. The figures after both the Government and NHS England pledged to eliminate all waits of more than a year by March 2025. Meanwhile, England's A&E crisis continues with more than 30,000 emergency department patients facing a 12-hour wait to be admitted to hospital - a record high. In addition to a raft of NHS data today there are reports that some heart attack patients are now facing an eight hour wait for an ambulance in some parts of the country.

            Millions of over-50s will be able to book their autumn booster and flu jabs from tomorrow. Phone and online bookings for the latest Covid jab will open to around 12million people aged between 50 and 64. And for the first time, those eligible for a flu vaccine will be able to book an appointment online under a new pilot with more than 200 sites across the country. Health officials are worried about the potential for a 'twindemic' this winter with high levels of flu expected to circulate alongside Covid. Flu jabs are being offered at thousands of community pharmacies and GP surgeries across England.

        Putting human cells into animal brains is a moral grey area, because of fears animals may start to think more like humans as a result. The latest research was done by Stanford University.

            Health chiefs are in crisis mode because the NHS is running out of blood. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) declared its first-ever amber alert status over the dwindling supplies. The move means trusts across England will have to start cancelling elective procedures, like hip replacements, because blood supplies to hospitals cannot be guaranteed. Current blood stocks stand at around three days, but levels of the universal blood type O negative have fallen below two days, officials said. NHSBT aims to keep blood stocks for all types at around six days.

            Many of us know that smoking is very bad for you. It damages your lungs, increases the risk of cancer and its costs a lot of money. But regardless many of us still smoke. In England alone nearly six million adults smoke and almost 31 million adults smoke in the US. The positive impacts of quitting can be seen after just 20 minutes explains Louise Ross a stop smoking expert based in Leicester.

            Karen Walters, 58, from Sussex, was lost 'devastated' when her boss at work told her she 'took up too much space behind the bar' weighing 24st (left, centre, and left inset). The mother said: 'I burst into tears. Some people told me I should make a formal complaint, but I just wanted to get out of there.' She went on to lose over 7st, while her daughter, Karen, also adopted a healthier diet (right).

            In a world first, doctors will use the genetic screening tool to diagnose illnesses in children from cancer to cystic fibrosis, with results within days rather than weeks. Health experts say the simple blood test which looks for genetic faults in a patient's DNA will speed up treatment for the seriously-ill, saving thousands of young lives every year. It follows a successful pilot involving 20,000 babies earlier this year, inspired by former Prime Minister David Cameron's son, Ivan. Today, the head of the NHS will hail it as the start of a 'new era of genomic medicine'. Speaking at the inaugural genomics healthcare summit in London, Amanda Pritchard will say she has seen how 'these simple blood tests can change the lives of babies and their families'. The scheme helped seven-month-old Reuben, who was fighting for his life at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.

        Cruising on an electric bike won't help you hit your exercise goals, a study suggest. German experts found cyclists who rely on pedal power are more likely to hit fitness targets than e-bikers.

And while she says some people may feel 'more adventurous' when they have a few drinks, others say sober sober sex can 'trump' being intimate while drunk (left, stock image, and right, Tracey Cox).

            Health Secretary Therese Coffey today claimed the rule-change to outlaw smoking in cars with children was probably not 'the right thing to be doing'. Dr Coffey made the controversial statement as it was revealed she plans to U-turn on the Government's pledge to unveil an action plan to tackle tobacco use. The cigar-puffing Liz Truss ally said she voted against the law change in 2015 because she didn't believe in telling parents what to do.

            Stretching your muscles is often a key part of exercise routines and rehabilitation programmes set by physiotherapists.  It can help by lengthening muscles and increasing their range of movement - but it can prevent injuries from happening in the first place, too, by boosting flexibility. Stretching can also relieve pain from injuries to our tendons, such as in the lower leg, which can easily be injured during everyday activities.

            After being unable to close her mouth properly for years, Leona Clarke, 41, from London, paid £6,000 to have two gruelling dental surgeries in Turkey in 2020. Having suffered with gingivitis as a child, the stay-at-home mother claims the condition caused her front teeth to protrude from where her gums had receded. Opening up about the effect it had on her self-esteem, Leona (pictured left, before treatment, and right, after) said: 'My teeth were horrific, they were big, bulky and embarrassing.' Witnessing the impact it was having on Leona's everyday life, the mother's step-sister suggested that she look into having her teeth fixed in early 2020. However when she approached various UK dentists, Leona was told that she needed to have 'all fours' - otherwise known as implants and crowns - fitted which would cost £22,000. At this point, Leona started looking into cheaper procedures in Turkey and found a £6,000 package which included implants, bone graft, sinus lift and crowns.

            Jodie Comer (left) is the most mathematically beautiful celebrity, according to mapping done by a Harley Street surgeon, with superstar Zendaya (right) a close second and model Bella Hadid in third. The 29-year-old Killing Eve star's eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, chin, jaw and facial shape were found to be 94.52% accurate under the Golden Ratio of Beauty Phi. The technique dates back to ancient times and has been used to measure physical perfection.

            With NHS waiting lists at record levels, more of us are being driven to spend precious money on private medical treatments. With a staggering 6.7 million people currently waiting for hospital treatment in England, around half of us would consider going private for medical care, according to the Independent Healthcare Providers Network. Indeed, 40 per cent more people paid for private treatment last year than in 2019. And while the vast majority will receive excellent care, this Good Health investigation reveals worrying gaps in the regulation of UK private healthcare, allowing some clinics to provide treatments that are clinically unproven and, according to some experts, dangerous.

            Midwifery degrees starting this month will teach students how to look after 'pregnant people' and 'birthing parents', rather than 'women'. The courses, which train midwives for the NHS, have replaced references to mothers with 'gender neutral' language to accommodate trans people. Several degree courses starting this autumn have used the 'inclusive' language on their websites or in course materials. However, critics said it risked dehumanising women and reducing them to 'bodies' which give birth. At the University of Bradford, an internal document detailing the course specifications for the 2022/23 year refers to 'childbearing people' four times and 'birthing people' eight times.

      DR MEGAN ROSSI: Oral bacteria sounds like something your dentist would tell you off about. Yet just like your gut and on your skin, your mouth is home to a vibrant - and important - community of bacteria and other microbes (known as the oral microbiota) that you actually want to encourage. That's because they're vital not just for your dental health but for your digestion, overall health and disease risk. So far scientists have identified around 700 different species of oral microbes. You probably have 250 to 300 of them resident in your mouth right now. This community of microbes remains relatively stable, despite an influx of other microbes from food, drink, breathing, nail-biting - and kissing (but more on that later).

            A report co-authored by disgraced scientist Dr Peter Daszak has claimed there is 'no evidence' Covid was created in a laboratory. The international group of scientists say the virus likely jumped to humans at the animal slaughter market at the epicenter in Wuhan. They cite recent studies which found the majority of early cases visited or had links to stalls in the southwestern corner of the market, where animals that can harbor Covid were sold for meat or fur at the time. But there will be questions about the impartiality of the report given Dr Daszak's links to the Chinese lab at the center of the pandemic. His EcoHealth Alliance research organization funneled US taxpayer money into the Wuhan Institute of Virology to carry out risky research on bat-borne coronaviruses.
