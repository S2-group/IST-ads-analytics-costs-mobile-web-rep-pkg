        The football world has turned on Cristiano Ronaldo in the latest controversial chapter of his topsy-turvy spell at Manchester United - after he stormed down the tunnel yet again before his side had beaten Tottenham 2-0 on Wednesday night.  Erik ten Hag's men completed an impressive victory over Spurs at Old Trafford thanks to goals from Fred and Bruno Fernandes - but the three points were quickly overshadowed by more theatricalities from the Portuguese outcast as he made for the dressing room prior to the final whistle. Ronaldo has received a round of stern criticism from the pundits for his behaviour as speculation around his future at the club continues to swirl - with talkSport's Gabriel Agbonlahor leading the fury at the forward.

       CHRIS WHEELER AT OLD TRAFFORD: Erik ten Hag will take action over Cristiano Ronaldo's latest strop on Thursday after the Portugal star stormed away from Manchester United's victory over Tottenham at Old Trafford before full-time. Ronaldo responded to being left on the bench as an unused substitute by disappearing down the tunnel in the 89th minute, and Sportsmail understands he may even have left the stadium before the match finished. Ten Hag didn't give an answer when he was asked if Ronaldo had been given permission to leave. The United manager said: 'I have seen him, but I didn't speak to him. I will deal with that tomorrow, not today. We are celebrating this victory. I don't pay attention today. I will deal with it tomorrow. I want to keep the focus on the team and a magnificent performance from all 11 players and the subs who came on. It was a squad performance.' It is the second time Ronaldo has left a United game without permission under Ten Hag. In July, the 37-year-old exited Old Trafford at half-time after being substituted in a pre-season friendly against Rayo Vallecano.

        United's victory, which was the best performance under Ten Hag, was overshadowed when Ronaldo reacted to not being brought on by disappearing down the tunnel in the 89th minute.

      TOM COLLOMOSSE: Michael Beale has rejected the chance to join Wolves leaving the Premier League strugglers still hunting for a new manager. Wolves had made the Queens Park Rangers boss, who had taken charge of only 17 games, their first choice to succeed Bruno Lage, after being turned down by Julen Lopetegui last month. Wolves were prepared to pay Beale’s £1million release clause and were confident of having him in place for Sunday’s clash with Leicester. But after leading QPR to the top of the Championship with a 3-0 win over Cardiff on Tuesday, Beale decided to stay in west London.

        The Red Devils legend hailed the 'balance' that the Brazilian has brought to a notoriously lack-lustre Man United midfield since his high-profile switch from European Champions Real Madrid this summer.

       Chelsea boss Graham Potter and Brentford manager Thomas Frank took the unusual step of interviewing each other before their teams drew 0-0 on Wednesday night. The Blues continued their unbeaten run since new boss Potter took over from Thomas Tuchel, even though they dropped two points at the Gtech Community Stadium - and arguably the most entertaining moment game before kick off. Appearing on Amazon Prime Sport's pre-match show, Potter and Frank joined host Simon Thomas and pundit Gianfranco Zola to preview their game.

            Ronaldo responded to being left on the bench as an unused substitute by disappearing down the tunnel in the 89th minute, and Sportsmail understands he may even have left the stadium before the match finished. United boss Erik ten Hag is expected to take action over the 37-year-old's latest strop. It is the second time Ronaldo has left a United game without permission under Ten Hag. In July, the 37-year-old exited Old Trafford at half-time after being substituted in a pre-season friendly against Rayo Vallecano.

            MARTIN KEOWN: I respected Ruud van Nistelrooy's talent and I still do. A brilliant goalscorer. A penalty-box predator. An undisputed winner for Manchester United. People have been asking me about the Battle of Old Trafford on an almost daily basis for the best part of 20 years. But the context is often forgotten. When Arsenal won the title at Old Trafford in May 2002, Van Nistelrooy stamped on my foot while I was marking him. I missed the final game of Arsenal's season as a result and was a doubt for that summer's World Cup.

       Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk appeared to stamp on the penalty spot just before Jarrod Bowen's effort was saved by Alisson in the Reds' 1-0 win over West Ham on Wednesday night.  Jurgen Klopp's men secured their second successive victory in the Premier League and look be gaining their confidence back following a difficult season so far - but it was not straightforward against the Hammers as Darwin Nunez's strike proved to be the only goal of the game.  And West Ham could have snatched a result from the game had Bowen not missed his effort, though some eagle-eyed fans spotted that just before he fluffed his effort, Van Dijk had put his studs into the penalty spot.

            ELLERY HANLEY: Samoa just didn't turn up. They didn't have the desire to get back to their feet. On one occasion, I saw three players on the floor by the time England had got the ball moving again. That is never a good sign. But England can't be blamed for Samoa's shortcomings. They were brilliant across the park and were completely dominant, which will put them in a great place mentally.

            The midfielder scored a fine second goal as Manchester United beat Tottenham 2-0 in the Premier League, before Ronaldo stormed down the tunnel before the end of the match as an unused substitute. Shearer, speaking on commentary for Amazon Prime Video, said Fernandes 'done so much' for United in the game, praising the Portugal international's performance with Ronaldo absent. Shearer gave the 28-year-old his 'Player of the Match' award for the game, before Fernandes insisted he is prepared to be less involved if the team performs better.

            Manchester United fans have slammed Cristiano Ronaldo for storming down the tunnel before full-time against Tottenham and have labelled him 'a petulant child' for doing so. The United superstar was an unused substitute as Erik ten Hag's side ripped Spurs apart and cruised to a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford. In dramatic fashion, he left the dugout before the final whistle had gone. Users on social media have now hit back at the United No 7 for his actions and claimed that he's 'tarnished' his legacy at the club.

            CHRIS WHEELER AT OLD TRAFFORD: David De Gea was speaking to us in a hotel room on the 11th floor of the Ritz-Carlton in Perth in July when he expressed a desire to see out his career at Manchester United. Trouble is, even the best players rarely get to write their own scripts. Just ask Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese superstar has scored more Premier League goals against Tottenham than any other opponent - including a hat-trick in this fixture last season - but it only got him a place on the bench at Old Trafford on Wednesday night. In the build-up to the game, Erik ten Hag had been asked about the possibility of United granting De Gea his wish in the wake of the Spanish goalkeeper making his 500th appearance for the club in Sunday's goalless draw with Newcastle. Given that he is the first name on the teamsheet and has been ever-present in all 14 games under Ten Hag this season, there's every chance De Gea will beat Alex Stepney's record for a United keeper of 539 appearances before his £375,000-a-week contract runs out in the summer.

            CRAIG HOPE AT ST JAMES' PARK: Eddie Howe spent the early part of this week taking on the red half of Merseyside. His players then saw to the blue half on a fiery night at St James' Park. The Newcastle boss is not prone to pre-match headline-making. He probably would not have liked, on reflection, that his forceful response to Jurgen Klopp's claims about his club's limitless spending had set the agenda going into this game. So after a third win in four matches lifted the Magpies into fifth on full-time, Howe would have been far happier that it was his team up in lights.

            Former Liverpool legend Steven McManaman has brazenly defended Jurgen Klopp's touchline antics, insisting Anfield fans want the German to continue to be 'passionate'. The 50-year-old who spent nine years at Liverpool, winning the FA Cup and League Cup, maintains a close relationship with his former club and backed Klopp to behave himself in the dugout following his sending off against Man City on Sunday.

            Benzema had started the game in his regular purple and turquoise adidas X Speedflow.1 boots, before using the interval to switch for a special edition pair gifted him in honour of his first Ballon d'Or win on Monday. With his new pair of boots on the French striker managed to net his fifth LaLiga goal of the season, the second in Real's 3-0 win over Elche on Wednesday evening. The 34-year-old became the oldest winner of the award since Stanley Matthews in 1956, and was commemorated with his own pair of boots, as well as a special edition real Madrid shirt and golden tape. However only the boots were given time on the field in the 3-0 win over Elche, as Benzema marked his first game since being voted the world's best player with a goal.

        Wolves will have no problem triggering Beale's relatively small release clause, believed to be around the £1million mark. It would represent a dizzying rise for the 42-year-old.

            Federico Valverde, Karim Benzema and Marco Asensio scored to give Real Madrid a comfortable 3-0 win at bottom side Elche in LaLiga on Wednesday and the leaders also had three goals disallowed by VAR for offside in the build-ups. Real top the standings with 28 points, six ahead second-placed Barcelona who have a game in hand and host Villarreal on Thursday. Coming off a dominant 3-1 win over arch-rivals Barcelona in the El Clasico on Sunday, coach Carlo Ancelotti decided not to rest key players against winless Elche.

            EXCLUSIVE BY DAVID COVERDALE: Not for the first time, Herbie Farnworth has Old Trafford in his sights. The England centre is eyeing a visit there on November 19 for the Rugby League World Cup final. But there was once a time when Farnworth imagined playing with a different shaped ball at the Theatre of Dreams. 'When I was really young, I trained with Manchester United,' the 22-year-old says. 'I was there for a couple of years, but I didn't really take it too seriously. Then when I was 12, I played my first game of rugby league. From then on, rugby league has always been my passion.'

       Arsenal will 'cookie crumble' after Christmas despite their strong start to the season under Mikel Arteta, says former Gunners winger Jermaine Pennant. The north London club sit four points clear at the top of the Premier League after ten games, having claimed nine victories and suffered defeat on just one occasion. Their impressive early form has raised optimism that a title challenge could be on the cards at the Emirates - but Pennant thinks otherwise. The 39-year-old, who made 26 appearances in his six-year spell at Arsenal, instead expects his old side to collapse later in the season like they did last term.

            Claressa Shields (left) has been beaten just once as an amateur or a professional, and on Saturday night she claimed revenge over the opponent who inflicted that loss. Banishing the demons of a fateful match-up in China some 10 years back, a result that still clearly haunted - or at least inflamed - the Flint-born American, Shields delivered a truly exquisite performance as she silenced 'The Silent Assassin', Savannah Marshall.  In doing so, Shields - who brands herself the GWOAT - remained unbeaten as a professional as she became a three-time undisputed champion and added further validation to her self-proclaimed title. However, whether Shields is actually the greatest is a debate to be had, with Katie Taylor (right) also in the mix.

       A Colombian top division soccer player stunned fans on Saturday by pulling out his penis as a means of distracting an opponent before a dangerous free-kick. In a moment of madness, Independiente Santa Fe defender Geisson Perea exposed his penis while standing in the wall, while a player from Jaguares de Cordoba lined up a free kick.  It is thought Perera was using the ballsy tactic as a means of distracting the player - and it appeared to work as the Jaguares man skewed his effort wide of the target -- and thankfully Perea's package too.

            Few fighters have been earmarked as champions-elect with as much conviction as Islam Makhachev. Known for a significant portion of his career as the next iteration of Khabib Nurmagomedov, and now his mentor has retired - the Dagestani heir apparent as lightweight champion, his destiny was pre-set in the eyes of many fans. Makhachev carries the weight of a lineage started by Khabib's late father Abdulmanap and there is enormous internal, as well as external pressure for the 31-year-old.

            Barcelona manager Xavi claims he will be axed and replaced by a new coach if their expensive summer business doesn't bring trophies this season. Xavi was afforded almost £150million worth of new signings by Barca's hierarchy in the summer; with the arrival of Robert Lewandowski, Jules Kounde, Raphinha, Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie dramatically lifting expectations at the club. Yet so far this season the Catalans have failed to live up to the hype, losing two of their first four Champions League games to leave themselves on the brink of a group-stage exit while also suffering defeat in Sunday's El Clasico against Real Madrid. The pressure is mounting on Xavi to get his new-look squad competing for silverware, and the legendary former Barca midfielder admits his head is on the chopping block.

            A key part of last season's success was owed to Postecoglou's knowledge of what some saw as unusual markets for Scottish sides to be dipping into. Indeed, one person in the know told Sportsmail that was a significant reason for Celtic hiring the Australian. Last summer, Postecoglou brought in Kyogo Furuhashi from Vissel Kobe - a player who almost immediately endeared himself to the Celtic faithful. A quick and nimble forward player, Kyogo scored eight Scottish Premiership goals in 15 appearances last season.
