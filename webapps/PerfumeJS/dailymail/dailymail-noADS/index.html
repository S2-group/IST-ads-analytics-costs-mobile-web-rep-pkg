                  Endgame looms for Truss: PM summons 1922 chief Graham Brady to No10 after Tories bombard him with

                    Graham Brady, the chair of the Tory 1922 committee, is in No10 meeting the PM after 24 hours of
                    carnage that saw the Home Secretary quit, confusion over whether the Chief Whip had followed her out
                    of the door, and MPs wrestling in Commons voting lobbies. No10 sources said the premier invited the
                    party shop steward in for a discussion - but denied that she has any intention of resigning. The
                    showdown comes as a series of previously-loyal MPs joining calls for her to go. Even supportive
                    Cabinet ministers had been conceding the situation is 'terminal'. Transport Secretary Anne-Marie
                    Trevelyan was sent out to prop up the PM this morning, but would only say that 'at the moment' she
                    believes Ms Truss will lead the Tories into the next election. The growing clamour came as 1922
                    committee chief Graham Brady is expected to meet other officers to consider Ms Truss's future. But
                    the main obstacle remains the lack of consensus on who should take over and what the process should
                    be, with little appetite for a drawn-out contest. There are signs leadership battle lines are
                    already being drawn, with former minister Crispin Blunt openly calling for Jeremy Hunt to get the
                    keys to No10. Nadine Dorries warned the only person who could return in a 'coronation' is Boris
                    Johnson. Other MPs want Rishi Sunak or Penny Mordaunt to take over.

                        Communications in Shetland have been completely shut down with phones, internet and computers in
                        a total blackout. Police have declared a major incident after the south subsea cable between the
                        islands and the mainland was cut and are patrolling to try and reassure residents. Northern
                        Police said in a tweet: 'Engineers are working to fix a complete outage on Shetland affecting
                        its connection to the main line.'

                      Two eco-zealots sprayed the iconic store in Knightsbridge, central London, at around 9am as part
                      of an ongoing protest over new oil and gas licences and consents. Twenty supporters of the group
                      have also glued themselves to the road outside, with others have 'locked themselves together'. It
                      comes as police have made more than 500 arrests so far this month as Just Stop Oil carries out
                      continues its 'civil resistance' throughout October. On Sunday, protesters sprayed orange paint
                      over an Aston Martin showroom in Park Lane, before more than a dozen blocked a four-lane road
                      nearby in a similar stunt.

                      55-year-old Jason Galbraith-Marten KC (pictured left), of Fulham, west London, has been pursued in
                      courts by former spouse Catherine de Renée (pictured right), 45, a portrait artist, since their
                      split in 2009 after two and a half years of marriage. Ms de Renée was unhappy with the £72,000
                      financial settlement she received following their divorce, while Mr Galbraith-Marten remained in
                      his £1.6million home (inset) with his current wife. In 2019, Ms de Renée was banned by a judge
                      from launching further legal challenges without permission after several 'fabricated' allegations
                      against Mr Galbraith-Marten, including criminal behaviour ranging 'from attempted murder' and
                      'attacks on her cat'. Now, High Court judge Mr Justice Mostyn has thrown out Ms de Renée's latest
                      bid to seek a £230,000 lump sum for her 15-year-old daughter, who attends a London state school,
                      to be privately educated.

                      Residents on Divinity Road in Oxford took matters in their own hands after the physical poles
                      designed to reduce traffic on their neighbourhood street were removed. Oxfordshire County Council
                      (OCC) has set up a number of low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) in the area to prevent vehicles
                      taking shortcuts through a residential area with the aim of creating quieter and safer streets.
                      This included installing bollards, but the scheme has proved controversial and has been criticised

                    <p>

                      The chaos surrounding Liz Truss today has at its heart one seemingly straightforward question:
                      what does the Conservative Party do with her? The Tories have two equally basic answers to that
                      question: they either find a way to get rid or her or step back and keep her in power. But it is
                      there than any sort of simplicity disappears. Ms Truss yesterday vowed that she is a 'fighter, not
                      a quitter' and suggesting she wants to fight on to the next election. But with calls for her to
                      quit as Tory leader mounting, this feels increasingly unlikely, if not totally impossible. This
                      means that she must either a) be convinced to change her mind and leave No10 in a dignified manner
                      or b) have the decision of whether or not to go taken out of her hands and be humiliatingly booted
                      out.

                        the Home Secretary resign and reports of tears and tear-ups in the Commons over fracking.

                      Ms Truss may soon be the shortest serving Prime Minister in history with some of her MPs calling
                      on her to go this morning 'in order to stop the shambles'. Her power began to slip away when
                      Suella Braverman quit at 5pm last night, apparently after a 90-minute screaming match that was
                      apparently heard reverberating through the office door and into No 10. And around two hours later
                      it all kicked off in the Commons. Labour MP Chris Bryant said that some Conservatives were
                      'physically manhandled into another lobby and being bullied' and revealed that he had 'utterly
                      desperate' Tory MPs 'crying on my shoulder'. Chief Whip Wendy Morton and her deputy Craig
                      Whittaker appeared to quit after Miss Truss reversed her plan to expel Tory MPs who voted against
                      the Government on fracking. At 1.30am this morning Downing Street insisted it was a confidence
                      vote only for a minister to go on TV at 7.30am to insist it wasn't, as party discipline imploded.
                      Amid chaotic scenes in the Commons, Deputy Prime Minister Therese Coffey and Business Secretary
                      Jacob Rees-Mogg were accused of 'manhandling' MPs through the voting lobbies - a claim both
                      ministers denied. As Government discipline collapsed, Mr Whittaker was heard telling his
                      colleagues: 'I am f***ing furious and I don't give a f*** any more.' Tory MPs were seen shouting
                      at an ashen-faced Miss Truss: 'It's a shambles.' The PM was apparently seen running after her
                      chief whip begging her not to quit while she was barracked by her own backbenchers. Jacob
                      Rees-Mogg later revealed he had no idea if the party still had a chief whip. And today there is
                      still confusion over whether Ms Morton and Mr Whittaker are in post.  Transport Secretary
                      Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the chief whip did not resign after last night's Commons vote, to her
                      knowledge. Asked if Wendy Morton quit on Wednesday evening, she said: 'Not that I'm aware of, no.'

                        Addressing the TUC conference in Brighton, Keir Starmer repeated his demand for an immediate
                        general election - with the Tories up to 36 points behind in the polls.

                      As reports emerged of MPs tussling with each other in the corridors of Parliament, enraptured
                      onlookers were unable to turn away, with some saying it was better than hit HBO show House of the
                      Dragon and others comparing it to some of the nation's favourite soap operas. The undignified
                      scenes in Westminster unfolded amid a vote on fracking late on Wednesday night, for which the
                      Government was thought to have imposed a strict three-line whip - meaning MPs who went against it
                      could be kicked out of the Tory party. As voting took place there were reports that some MPs were
                      in tears, others being frogmarched by cabinet ministers to vote and the Prime Minister Liz Truss
                      chasing after her own chief whip begging her not to resign. Earlier in the day Suella Braverman,
                      the Home Secretary, unexpectedly resigned, apparently after a 90-minute screaming match that could
                      be heard reverberating through the halls of Number 10. With so much taking place people on social
                      media were quick to poke fun, with Twitter users comparing it to a drunken brawl, satirical comedy
                      programmes and even Chernobyl.

                      Speaking on her talk show The View yesterday, Goldberg said the Duchess of Sussex's views could be
                      insulting to other women who were 'just trying to make a living' in the entertainment industry.
                      Meghan had made the comments on a recent episode of her podcast, saying her time on the show
                      between 2006 and 2007 left her feeling objectified and not seen as a real person. The
                      mother-of-two and former actress said while she was 'grateful' the job helped pay the bills, she
                      felt she was only valued for her 'beauty' and not her 'brains'. This prompted one of her former
                      co-stars to come out and say the programme had provided 'so many opportunities' for them and that
                      models who opened briefcases on the show were not chosen just because of their looks. Now Goldberg
                      has piled in, saying that she didn't think the people watching the show would have objectified the
                      briefcase girls, the Sun reports.

                      AMANDA PLATELL: A woman who hasn't seen her own father for years extolls the virtues of family:
                      that now frail, yet still-loving dad who funded her expensive education and has never met her
                      children or her husband. All of Meghan's own half-siblings have apparently been sent to Siberia -
                      and Harry has become virtually estranged from his own family since he met her. Note, by the way,
                      that 'self-love' comes before 'family love'... self-love is what counts most for Meghan I suspect.

                      Viewers were left disappointed as Kevin McCloud revisited Grand Designs' infamous North Devon
                      lighthouse which cost £7million to build in a special episode last night. The build, now on sale
                      for £10million, right, took 12 years to complete, costing Edward, inset, and Hazel Short their
                      marriage, and putting them on the edge of bankruptcy. However, looking at the finished property,
                      pictured, many felt it wasn't worth the heartache and money the couple poured into the project.
                      Meanwhile, their daughters Lauren and Nicole, bottom inset, have said they have felt 'over' the
                      build.

                        are struggling, with some full-time workers unable to afford dental care, glasses and food.

                        Until Jeremy Hunt dropped his energy price guarantee bombshell, the one bit of good news was
                        that at least we didn't have to worry quite as much as before about energy bills.

                      Prince Andrew has effectively been in lockdown in the three years since his disastrous Newsnight
                      interview, as insiders reveal the shamed Duke of York binge-watches TV box sets, barely leaves
                      home anymore and has been left wondering how his reputation has been left in tatters by his
                      friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Friends claim that Andrew privately admits his
                      appearance on the BBC's flagship news programme in 2019 - where he was grilled by Emily Maitlis
                      over claims that he abused Epstein 'sex-slave' Virginia Roberts Giuffre while she was a minor
                      under US law - was 'by no means his finest hour'. Though furious allies believe that he
                      was 'thrown under a bus' and cast as the 'archetypal pantomime villain' in the fallout, they
                      insist the duke is 'philosophical' about his exile from public life.Instead, the three years since
                      the interview has been a period of 'intense self-reflection' for the duke once dubbed the 'Playboy
                      Prince', who has spent time poring over 'every aspect of his life' to understand how 'everything
                      went so wrong, and why'.

                        General Surovikin, Russia's new commander in Ukraine, has warned of an attack on the dam at Nova
                        Kakhovka - leading analysts to conclude he is preparing for a 'false flag' operation by his own
                        men.

                        Alan Titchmarsh, 73, said 'all good wildlife gardens are managed' and that the craze of
                        rewilding - which aims to recreate an area's natural, uncultivated state - is causing gardens to
                        become 'less biodiverse'.

                      Jeff Guenther, from Oregon, has become a viral sensation on TikTok for often sharing his expertise
                      when it comes to the love and romance departments. He recently posted a video to his 2.2 million
                      followers breaking down how the different attachment styles can impact what happens in the
                      bedroom. According to the attachment theory, everyone develops one of four ways that they can
                      respond to conflict based off of the care they received as an infant. The four different
                      attachment styles include avoidant or dismissive, anxious or preoccupied, disorganized, and
                      secure. Now, Guenther has explained in his viral video, which has racked up two million views, how
                      your attachment style can heavily impact the way you perform during sex. He broke down three of
                      the styles, and revealed why some people are focused more on 'how they're performing' and less on
                      'connecting' during sex.

                      WARNING DISTRESSING CONTENT: Unearthed CCTV footage has revealed the shocking moment a man was
                      caught attacking his own cat, ruthlessly hitting him six times. Artur Zakowicz, 46, can be seen
                      violently grabbing his black and white pet, Bashik, by his skin and pulling him upwards whilst
                      beating him. During the attack - captured outside his home in Chester, Cheshire - the cat can be
                      seen frantically trying to wriggle free from its owners clutches.

                      Shocking footage shows an officer in combat fatigues demonstrating a Kalashnikov machine-gun and
                      an anti-tank grenade launcher to kindergarten youngsters. The 'teacher' is Pavel Firsov, from a
                      militaristic pro-Kremlin movement called Combat Brotherhood. Children at Kindergarten No. 31 in
                      Korolev, near Moscow were taught the 'qualities that distinguish a true defender of the
                      Motherland'. Firsov is a 'veteran of military operations' and regularly gives military lessons to
                      older children.

                      more than $20million, claiming it withheld payments from them. They claim in the lawsuit, obtained
                      by The Blast, that they entered into promotional agreements with the Australia-based company at
                      the behest of Mark Wahlberg (right), who owns a 36 percent stake in the company. But, they claim,
                      the company has failed to pay them 'substantial cash and equity compensation' as its shares
                      plummeted in the stock market.

                      EXCLUSIVE: The organisation Lady Freethinker (LFT) , based in Los Angeles, conducted the
                      investigation in August 2022. Footage taken by one of their investigators shows animal abuse and
                      mistreatment at each of the centres. The elephants are at the mercy of workers at the tourist
                      attractions, who are seen carrying bull hooks. LFT's investigation discovered that the animals
                      were visibly distressed and displaying signs of zoochosis, a behaviour found in animals in
                      captivity. They were swaying, bobbing and pacing in much of the footage while another elephant had
                      a wound on her cheek and a tear stain underneath her eye. Also in the video, a baby elephant
                      called Saan Suay was seen meeting a tourist and grabbed their shirt by her trunk. As punishment,
                      one of the workers at the centre smacked her with a bull hook handle twice. The calf was seen
                      backing away after the incident. Later, Saan Suay had a nail jabbed into her side multiple times
                      and was seen swaying from side to side.

                      Sukhmin Garcha, 27, a skin educator, proposed to her partner, Shiraz Brar, 27, a dental hygienist,
                      who both live in Vancouver, Canada in July. But after a video capturing the twist on typical
                      gender roles went viral, Sukhmin says she was trolled by women telling her she had no self
                      respect, she should be embarrassed and that her partner didn't look happy about her proposing to
                      him.

                      Sergeant Eric Huxley with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police is facing federal charges after
                      bodycam footage showed him stomping on the face of a black man. Jermaine Vaughn was kicked in the
                      face by the left foot of Sgt. Huxley despite him already being on the ground and in handcuffs.
                      After Vaughn is kicked he appears dazed on the ground, while another officer can be heard telling
                      him, 'You're done,' at least four times. It was two weeks before the police chief was made aware
                      of the incident. Huxley, a 14-year veteran, is  now facing termination together with felony
                      charges of battery and official misconduct.

                      Located halfway between Hawaii and California, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is estimated to
                      contain a whopping 2.41 million tonnes of plastic - and is continuing to grow. Scientists are
                      desperately trying to clear the build-up, and this month have been able to extract 10 tonnes
                      (10,086kg) of plastic, bringing the total of plastic removed to 145 tonnes (145,518 kg). The Ocean
                      Cleanup, a project aimed at cleaning up the GPGP, aims to reduce floating plastic by 90 per cent
                      by 2040.

                        work in the same way as Covid swabs - following the nation's unprecedented monkeypox outbreak.

                      The world's best restaurant, according to Tripadvisor, isn't on a glitzy street in London, Rome,
                      Paris or Manhattan, but in the quaint, often rain-soaked town of Ambleside in the north of
                      England's Lake District, housed in the building poet William Wordsworth used as an office when he
                      was a tax collector, distributing revenue stamps. In a nod to its origins, it's called the Old
                      Stamp House, and was the overall global winner of Tripadvisor's 2022 Travellers' Choice 'Best of
                      the Best' Restaurants Awards. And it won the previous year, too. The eatery also boasts a coveted
                      Michelin star. So what makes this universally lauded restaurant tick? MailOnline Travel had a chat
                      with Chef Patron Ryan Blackburn over Zoom to find out.

                      This year's final shortlist of 40 standalone photographs and 10 Portfolio entries includes a
                      charming little raccoon waving to the camera, a pretty cool fox tipping us the wink, a squirrel
                      superhero flying through the air and a galloping, farting zebra, really giving it some welly.
                      These images have been whittled down from thousands of entries submitted from professional and
                      amateur photographers from all around the world presenting a wonderful eclectic mix of hilarious
                      wildlife. The Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards was co-founded in 2015 by professional
                      photographers Paul Joynson-Hicks MBE and Tom Sullam who wanted to create a competition that
                      focused on the lighter, humorous side of wildlife photography but also had an important role in
                      promoting wildlife conservation at its heart. The Overall Winner, Category and Highly Commended
                      Winners will be announced on December 8 with the top image winning an incredible one-week safari
                      with Alex Walker's Serian in the Masai Mara, Kenya, as well as a unique handmade trophy from the
                      Art Garage in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

                      This is the moment a brave paramedic flew up a hill in winds of over 30 miles per hour and heavy
                      rain using a jet pack.It marks a new milestone for the Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS),
                      as this was the first time one of their team has been able to fly up a slope with the Jet Suit.
                      The flight was part of a trial of the Jet Suit technology, with the goal of medics using it to
                      reach patients in remote locations, like in the Lake District. Developed by inventor Richard
                      Browning from Gravity Industries, the flying suit can reach impressive speeds of up to 85 miles
                      per hour at more than 12,000 feet into the air. It relies on five mini jet engines, two built into
                      units attached to each hand and one built into a backpack, which gives it a flight time of up to
                      ten minutes. After about ten days of training, GNAAS paramedic Jamie Walsh made the flight up a
                      short, steep ascent in adverse weather conditions, and was joined by Mr Browning. Mr Browning
                      said: 'It is fantastic to see the progress we have delivered since the proof of concept back in
                      2020. It was a true privilege to fly, literally, alongside Jamie, noting how far we have come in
                      applying Jet Suit technology in the world of medical response.'

                      In a video clip, the Mountain View, California tech giant's robot is seen effortlessly sliding
                      along its side of the ping pong table as it returns the human's shots. The monumental rally ends
                      when the robot sends a weak shot into the net, more than four minutes after it started. Google
                      describes the technology as 'a research platform for agile robotics' that can answer questions
                      about human-robot interaction and cooperation.

                      Jane McKennan, 64, (left) from Plymouth, wore a Peppa Pig suit in a video of herself frying bacon
                      (right) that left most people squealing with laughter as it racked up 1.5 million views on TikTok.
                      The childminder of 30 years said she wasn't bothered by the grilling disgruntled vegans gave her
                      for the comedy sketch. In the video, she waddled towards a stove and mimes the words: 'I'm Peppa
                      Pig.' She picked up three rashers of bacon and as she placed them one by one into the pan and
                      said: 'This is my little brother George, this is Mummy Pig and this is Daddy Pig.' While it left
                      most people crying with laughter, sensitive vegans and vegetarians slammed the hilarious sketch as
                      offensive to pigs, who they claim are murdered for food.

                      Every season has its quintessential location. Who does not want to be beside the sea in summer, or
                      standing on a mountain in the freshening breeze of spring? As for winter, where better to be than
                      a metropolis, with the bright lights of the big city reflecting off its wet pavements. But come
                      autumn the mind drifts inevitably to the countryside: the woods, orchards and lanes of Britain
                      where the trees and bushes become heavy with fruit, and the rich earth erupts with mushrooms.
                      There, birds sing in the seasons. Just as the cuckoo announces spring, so the fieldfare is the
                      herald of autumn.
